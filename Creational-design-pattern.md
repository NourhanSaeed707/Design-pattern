# Creational Design Pattern: 
- These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.
## When Will We Need Builder Design Pattern?
- Imagine that we want to build software that accepts customers' details and stores them in a database. Customers are shown a form that accepts the below **mandatory** and **optional** fields.
- **Mandatory Fields** - First Name, Last Name, Primary Email, and Primary Mobile Number
- **Optional Fields** - Middle Name, Secondary Email, and Secondary Mobile Number
- Ideally, we create a Customer class with the **mandatory** and **optional** attributes listed above. We create a constructor that accepts the above attributes. Since some attributes are optional, we may need to pass null values to those attributes we don't want to use. The builder design pattern lets us create an object step by step without passing all the values to the constructor.
- Builder design pattern eliminates the telescopic constructor(**suppose that we have a class with multiple properties where some properties are mandatory and others are optional. Thus, we must have multiple constructors and most of these constructors will be created just for convenience.** ) problem where we create several overloaded constructors with fewer arguments.

## 1. Buider:
- Builder pattern was introduced to solve some of the problems with Factory and Abstract Factory design patterns when the Object contains a lot of attributes. There are three major issues with Factory and Abstract Factory design patterns when the Object contains a lot of attributes.
1. Too Many arguments to pass from client program to the Factory class that can be error prone because most of the time, the type of arguments are same and from client side its hard to maintain the order of the argument.
2. Some of the parameters might be optional but in Factory pattern, we are forced to send all the parameters and optional parameters need to send as NULL.
3. If the object is heavy and its creation is complex, then all that complexity will be part of Factory classes that is confusing.

- We can solve the issues with large number of parameters by providing a constructor with required parameters and then different setter methods to set the optional parameters. The problem with this approach is that the Object state will be inconsistent until unless all the attributes are set explicitly. **Builder pattern solves the issue with large number of optional parameters and inconsistent state by providing a way to build the object step-by-step and provide a method that will actually return the final Object.**

## Builder Design Pattern in Java:
- Letâ€™s see how we can implement builder design pattern in java.
1. First of all you need to create a static nested class and then copy all the arguments from the outer class to the Builder class. We should follow the naming convention and if the class name is **Computer** then builder class should be named as **ComputerBuilder**.
2. Java Builder class should have a public constructor with all the required attributes as parameters.
3. Java Builder class should have methods to set the optional parameters and it should return the same Builder object after setting the optional attribute.
4. The final step is to provide a **build()** method in the builder class that will return the Object needed by client program. For this we need to have a private constructor in the Class with Builder class as argument.

## Lets's explain the above UML image:
- **Product**: The product class defines the type of the complex object that is to be generated by the builder pattern.
- **Builder**: This abstract base class defines all of the steps that must be taken in order to correctly create a product. Each step is generally abstract as the actual functionality of the builder is carried out in the concrete subclasses. The GetProduct method is used to return the final product. The builder class is often replaced with a simple interface.
- **ConcreteBuilder**: There may be any number of concrete builder classes inheriting from Builder. These classes contain the functionality to create a particular complex product.
- **Director**: The director-class controls the algorithm that generates the final product object. A director object is instantiated and its Construct method is called. The method includes a parameter to capture the specific concrete builder object that is to be used to generate the product. The director then calls methods of the concrete builder in the correct order to generate the product object. On completion of the process, the GetProduct method of the builder object can be used to return the product.

## We have two ways to implement builder pattern:
## 1. implement product class and builder class:
