# Defination:
- Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies abstraction and implementationâ€”which can be developed independently of each other.
- is used to decouple the interfaces from implementation and hiding the implementation details from the client programs.
- There are 2 parts in Bridge design pattern : 
1. Abstraction
2. Implementation

# Explanation:
- We have a abstraction **(FifoCollection)** and Implementor **(LinkedList)**,  have a refined Abstraction **(Queue)** that implements **(FifoCollection)** and inside **Queue** we hava a object from Implementor **(LinkedList)** that mean of composition.
- Then we have a two concrete implementor. that implements Implemenor **(LinkedList)** that classes are **SinglyLinkedList** and **ArrayLinkedList**

# Example in java:
- java.sql.DriverManager class with The java.sql.Driver interface form a bridge patter
