# Defination
- is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
- Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object. Composite pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy.

# Explanation:
- We start by implementing a Component class **(File)** and leaf class **(BinaryFile)** that extends from **File class**, and a Directory class **(Directory)** that extends from **File class**.
