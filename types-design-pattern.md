# Design pattern:
- GoF Patterns(Gang of Four design pattern)
- Modern Patterns
- we're going to study Gang of Four Pattern and here is a example of it:
## GoF Design Pattern Types:
1. Creational: These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.

2. Structural: These patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition.

3. Behavioral:  These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others.

## Creational design pattern list:
- Builder
- Simple Factory
- Factory Method
- Prototype
- Singleton
- Abstract Factory
- Object Pool
